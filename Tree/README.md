# Tree
Write a program that takes as input two integers x and y.
Based on the integers the program generates randomly tree
structure having depth = x and every nodes(except any leaf)
has y children. Every nodes can be either
ISimpleNode (contains only integer value) or
IColoredNode (containing integer value and color like
red, green, blue, yellow, white) or
ShapedNode (having number, color and Shape like
rectangle, triangle, diamond, circle).
After the tree is generated a console menu should be shown
where the user can search for nodes by either number or color
or shape or combinations between these 3 properties.
